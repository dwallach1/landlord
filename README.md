Inspired by the following tweet,

I was curious to see what this would look like as a smart contract implementation with a small react app showcasing how it could be used. 

Does this have any overlap with Flexa's collateral manager: https://github.com/flexahq/flexa-collateral-manager ? Can we build upon this for this use case or no?


Hoping to work on this project as I get time :)
